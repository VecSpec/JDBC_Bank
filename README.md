# JDBC_Bank
Test program for a banking app that utilizes Java & Oracle SQL. Mostly for training/rust-shaking purposes. May work on it more over time.

The program utilizes a database to store data for customers, admins, and bank accounts, using Java to both create and alter those accounts
and data.

I'll...finish this later. XD
